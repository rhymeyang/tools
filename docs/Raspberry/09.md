# Plan

Yes, you can use two Raspberry Pi 4 devices to simulate parts of the story for an AI-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for fleet management security. Hereâ€™s how you might go about it:

### Hardware Setup

1. **Two Raspberry Pi 4s**: One can simulate the fleet management system, while the other acts as the intrusion detection system.
2. **Network Setup**: Both Raspberry Pis need to be connected to a network, possibly using Wi-Fi or Ethernet. This will allow for network communication and potential simulation of network attacks.

### Software and Simulation Components

1. **Fleet Management Simulation (Raspberry Pi 1)**:
   - Install and configure a GPS server like **Traccar** or **OpenGTS**.
   - Simulate vehicle data input, such as GPS locations, vehicle speed, etc. You might need to write scripts or use existing tools to generate realistic GPS data.
   - Simulate login attempts and system interactions, which can be done through scripts that perform actions on the fleet management system.
2. **AI-Based IDS (Raspberry Pi 2)**:
   - Develop or deploy a machine learning model capable of detecting anomalies in the data received from the first Raspberry Pi. Python with libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch can be used for machine learning tasks.
   - Integrate with a SIEM tool for alerting. Although full versions of Splunk or ELK might be resource-intensive for a Raspberry Pi, lighter versions or alternatives like **Fluentd** or **Prometheus** can be considered.
3. **Cyberattack Simulation**:
   - Write Python scripts to simulate GPS spoofing by injecting fake GPS data into the fleet management system.
   - The IDS on the second Raspberry Pi should detect this anomaly based on the deviations from expected GPS data and possibly other indicators like unusual login patterns.
4. **Response Mechanisms**:
   - Automate responses such as blocking IPs or alerting administrators using scripts. This could also involve interfacing with the network settings on the Raspberry Pi to simulate blocking network traffic.

### Considerations

- **Performance**: Raspberry Pi 4 is quite powerful for its size but monitoring and processing in real-time may be limited by its processing power, especially if using advanced machine learning models.
- **Realism**: While you can simulate data and attacks, the complexity and scale of a real fleet management system and a sophisticated IDS will be more complex than what can be achieved with basic setups.
- **Scalability**: Prototypes like these are excellent for demonstrations and learning, but moving to a production environment would require more robust hardware and software solutions.

### Conclusion

Using two Raspberry Pi 4s is a great educational tool for prototyping and understanding the components of an IDS in a fleet management scenario. It provides a hands-on approach to learning about cybersecurity, networking, and AI-driven anomaly detection within a manageable and affordable setup.
