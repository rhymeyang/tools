Hereâ€™s how you might go about it:</p><h3 id="hardware-setup" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#hardware-setup"><span>Hardware Setup</span></a></h3><ol><li><strong>Two Raspberry Pi 4s</strong>: One can simulate the fleet management system, while the other acts as the intrusion detection system.</li><li><strong>Network Setup</strong>: Both Raspberry Pis need to be connected to a network, possibly using Wi-Fi or Ethernet. This will allow for network communication and potential simulation of network attacks.</li></ol><h3 id="software-and-simulation-components" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#software-and-simulation-components"><span>Software and Simulation Components</span></a></h3><ol><li><strong>Fleet Management Simulation (Raspberry Pi 1)</strong>: <ul><li>Install and configure a GPS server like <strong>Traccar</strong> or <strong>OpenGTS</strong>.</li><li>Simulate vehicle data input, such as GPS locations, vehicle speed, etc. You might need to write scripts or use existing tools to generate realistic GPS data.</li><li>Simulate login attempts and system interactions, which can be done through scripts that perform actions on the fleet management system.</li></ul></li><li><strong>AI-Based IDS (Raspberry Pi 2)</strong>: <ul><li>Develop or deploy a machine learning model capable of detecting anomalies in the data received from the first Raspberry Pi. Python with libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch can be used for machine learning tasks.</li><li>Integrate with a SIEM tool for alerting. Although full versions of Splunk or ELK might be resource-intensive for a Raspberry Pi, lighter versions or alternatives like <strong>Fluentd</strong> or <strong>Prometheus</strong> can be considered.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cyberattack Simulation</strong>: <ul><li>Write Python scripts to simulate GPS spoofing by injecting fake GPS data into the fleet management system.</li><li>The IDS on the second Raspberry Pi should detect this anomaly based on the deviations from expected GPS data and possibly other indicators like unusual login patterns.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Response Mechanisms</strong>: <ul><li>Automate responses such as blocking IPs or alerting administrators using scripts. This could also involve interfacing with the network settings on the Raspberry Pi to simulate blocking network traffic.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id="considerations" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#considerations"><span>Considerations</span></a></h3><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Raspberry Pi 4 is quite powerful for its size but monitoring and processing in real-time may be limited by its processing power, especially if using advanced machine learning models.</li><li><strong>Realism</strong>: While you can simulate data and attacks, the complexity and scale of a real fleet management system and a sophisticated IDS will be more complex than what can be achieved with basic setups.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Prototypes like these are excellent for demonstrations and learning, but moving to a production environment would require more robust hardware and software solutions.</li></ul><h3 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></a></h3><p>Using two Raspberry Pi 4s is a great educational tool for prototyping and understanding the components of an IDS in a fleet management scenario. It provides a hands-on approach to learning about cybersecurity, networking, and AI-driven anomaly detection within a manageable and affordable setup.</p>',10)]))}const c=t(o,[["render",s],["__file","09.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse('{"path":"/Raspberry/09.html","title":"Plan","lang":"zh-CN","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Hardware Setup","slug":"hardware-setup","link":"#hardware-setup","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Software and Simulation Components","slug":"software-and-simulation-components","link":"#software-and-simulation-components","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Considerations","slug":"considerations","link":"#considerations","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Conclusion","slug":"conclusion","link":"#conclusion","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1738605791000},"filePathRelative":"Raspberry/09.md"}');export{c as comp,d as data};
